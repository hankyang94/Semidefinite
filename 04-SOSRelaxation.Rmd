## Basic Algebraic Geometry

We first review several basic concepts in algebraic geometry. We refer to standard textbooks for a more comprehensive treatment [@bochnak13book-real], [@cox13book-ideals], [@dummit04book-abstract], [@lang12book-algebra].

### Groups, Rings, Fields

::: {.definitionbox}
::: {.definition #Group name="Group"}
A **group** consists of a set $G$ and a binary operation "$\cdot$" defined on $G$ that satisfies the following conditions:

1. Associative: $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$, for all $a,b,c \in G$.

2. Identity: there exists $1 \in G$ such that $1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a$, for all $a \in G$.

3. Inverse: Given $a \in G$, there exists $b \in G$ such that $a \cdot b = b \cdot a = 1$.
:::
:::

For example, the integers $\bbZ$ form a group under addition, but not under multiplication; the set $GL(n,\Real{})$ that contains nonsingular $n \times n$ matrices forms a group under the usual matrix multiplication. Another example is the set of rotation matrices $\SOd := \cbrace{R \in \Real{d \times d} \mid RR\tran = \eye_d, \det(R) = +1}$.

In a group we only have one binary operation ("multiplication"). We will introduce another operation ("addition").

::: {.definitionbox}
::: {.definition #Ring name="Commutative Ring"}
A **commutative ring** (with identity) consists of a set $S$ and two binary operations "$\cdot$" and "$+$" defined on $S$ that satisfy the following conditions 

1. Associative: $(a+b)+c = a + (b+c)$, and $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$, for all $a,b,c \in S$.

2. Commutative: $a+b=b+a$ and $a\cdot b = b \cdot a$, for all $a,b \in S$.

3. Distributive: $a \cdot (b+c) = a\cdot b + a \cdot c$ for all $a,b,c \in S$.

4. Identities: there exist $0, 1 \in S$ such that $a + 0 = a \cdot 1 = a$, for all $a \in S$.

5. Additive inverse: given $a \in S$, there exists $b \in S$ such that $a + b = 0$.
:::
:::

A simple example of a ring is the set of integers $\bbZ$ under the usual addition and multiplication.

If we add a requirement for the existence of multiplicative inverse, we obtain a field.

::: {.definitionbox}
::: {.definition #Field name="Field"}
A **field** consists of a set $S$ and two binary operations "$\cdot$" and "$+$" defined on $S$ that satisfy the following conditions 

1. Associative: $(a+b)+c = a + (b+c)$, and $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$, for all $a,b,c \in S$.

2. Commutative: $a+b=b+a$ and $a\cdot b = b \cdot a$, for all $a,b \in S$.

3. Distributive: $a \cdot (b+c) = a\cdot b + a \cdot c$ for all $a,b,c \in S$.

4. Identities: there exist $0, 1 \in S$, where $0 \neq 1$, such that $a + 0 = a \cdot 1 = a$, for all $a \in S$.

5. Additive inverse: given $a \in S$, there exists $b \in S$ such that $a + b = 0$.

6. Multiplicative inverse: given $a \in S$ and $a \neq 0$, there exists $c \in S$ such that $a \cdot c = 1$.
:::

Any field is obvious a commutative ring. Some commonly used fields are the rationals $\bbQ$, the reals $\Real{}$, and the complex numbers $\bbC$. Another important field is given by $k(x_1,\dots,x_n)$, the set of rational functions with coefficients in the field $k$, with the natural operations.

### Polynomials, Ideals, and Varieties

We will use $\bbF = \bbR$ or $\bbC$ to denote the field of real or complex numbers from now on. Let $x_1,\dots,x_n$ be indeterminates, we can define a polynomial.

::: {.definitionbox}
::: {.definition #Polynomial name="Polynomial"}
A polynomial $f$ in $x_1,\dots,x_n$ with coefficients in a field $\bbF$ is a finite linear combination of monomials:
$$
f = \sum_{\alpha} c_\alpha x^\alpha = \sum_{\alpha} c_\alpha x_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots x_n^{\alpha_n}, \quad c_\alpha \in \bbF,
$$
where the sum is over a finite number of $n$-tuples (exponents) $\alpha = (\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n)$, $\alpha_i \in \bbN$. The set of all polynomials in $x$ with coefficients in $\bbF$ is denoted $\bbF[x]$ or $\bbF[x_1,\dots,x_n]$.
:::
:::

The **degree** of a monomial is the sum of its exponents:
$$
\deg(x^\alpha) = \deg(x_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots x_n^{\alpha_n}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i.
$$
The degree of a polynomial is the maximum degree of its monomials:
$$
\deg(f) = \max_{\alpha} \deg(x^\alpha).
$$

It is clear that $\bbF[x]$ is a commutative ring with the $0$ and $1$ identities. 

A **form** is a polynomial where all the monomials have the same degree. It is also called a **homogeneous polynomial**. For example,
$$
f = 2 x_1^2 + x_1 x_2 + x_2^2
$$
is a form of degree $2$. A homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$ satisfies 
$$
f(\lambda x_1,\dots,\lambda x_n) = \lambda^d f(x_1,\dots,x_n).
$$

A polynomial in $n$ variables of degree $d$ has
$$
s(n,d) = \begin{pmatrix} n + d \\ d \end{pmatrix}
$$
coefficients. Let $\bbF[x]_{d}$ be the set of polynomials in $n$ variables of degree $d$, then any $f \in \bbF[x]_d$ can be written as 
$$
f = c\tran [x]_d, \quad c \in \bbF^{s(n,d)}
$$
with $[x]_d$ the **standard monomial basis** in $x$ of degree up to $d$. For example, when $x = (x_1,x_2)$, then 
$$
[x]_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_1^2 \\ x_1 x_2 \\ x_2^2 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Let $G$ be a set of polynomials, and $\bbF[G]$ denote the set of all polynomials that can be written as 
$$
\sum_{\alpha} c_\alpha g_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots g_k^{\alpha_k}, \quad c_\alpha \in \bbF, g_1,\dots,g_k \in G
$$
with finitely many nonzero coefficients. The polynomials in $G$ are called **generators** and $G$ is called a **generator set** for $\bbF[G]$. Clearly, the set 
$$
G = \{1, x_1, \dots, x_n\}
$$
is a generator set for $\bbF[x]$.

We consider next ideals, which are subrings with an “absorbent” property.

::: {.definitionbox}
::: {.definition #Ideal name="Ideal"}
Let $R$ be a commutative ring. A subset $I \subset R$ is an ideal if it satisfies 

1. $0 \in I$.

2. If $a, b \in I$, then $a + b \in I$.

3. If $a \in I$ and $b \in R$, then $a \cdot b \in I$.
:::
:::

A simple example of an ideal is the set of even integers, considered as a subset of the integer ring $\bbZ$. If the ideal $I$ contains the multiplicative identity "$1$", then $I = R$. For a tuple $h = (h_1,\dots,h_s)$ of polynomials in $\bbF[x]$, $\Ideal[h]:= \Ideal[h_1,\dots,h_m]$ denotes the smallest ideal containing $h$, or equivalently 
$$
\Ideal[h] = h_1 \cdot \bbF[x] + \cdots + h_s \cdot \bbF[x].
$$
The set $\Ideal[h]$ is called the ideal generated by $h$. Every ideal of $\bbF[x]$ is generated by finitely many polynomials, i.e., every ideal is **finitely generated**.

::: {.theorembox}
::: {.theorem #HilbertBasisTheorem name="Hilbert Basis Theorem"}
For every ideal $I \subseteq \bbF[x]$, there exist finitely many polynomials $g_1,\dots,g_m \in I$ such that $I = \Ideal[g_1,\dots,g_m]$.
:::
:::

We define the concept of an **algebraic variety** as the zero set of a set of polynomial equations.

::: {.definitionbox}
::: {.definition #AffineVariety name="Affine Variety"}
Let $f_1,\dots,f_s \in \bbF[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and $x = (x_1,\dots,x_n)$, and the set $V$ be 
$$
V_{\bbF}(f_1,\dots,f_s) = \cbrace{x \in \bbF^{n}\mid f_i(x) = 0, i=1,\dots,s}.
$$
We call $V_{\bbF}(f_1,\dots,f_s)$ the affine variety defined by $f_1,\dots,f_s$.
:::
:::

Similarly, let $I \subset \bbF[x]$ be an ideal, we denote its zero set as 
$$
V_{\bbF}(I) = \cbrace{x \in \bbF^n \mid f(x) = 0, \forall f \in I}.
$$
Since the ideal is finitely generated, we have 
$$
V_{\bbF}(I) = V_{\bbF}(g_1,\dots,g_m),
$$
where $g_1,\dots,g_m$ are the generators of $I$.

The set of polynomials that vanish in a given variety, i.e., 
$$
I(V)= \cbrace{f \in \bbF[x] \mid f(x) = 0, \forall x \in V},
$$
is an ideal, called the **vanishing ideal** of $V$.

We define the **radical** of an ideal.

::: {.definitionbox}
::: {.definition #Radical name="Radical"}
Let $I \subset \bbF[x]$ be an ideal. The radical of $I$, denoted $\sqrt{I}$, is the set 
$$
\sqrt{I} := \cbrace{f \mid f^k \in I \text{ for some integer }k}.
$$
:::
:::

It is clear that $I \subset \sqrt{I}$, and it can be shown that $\sqrt{I}$ is also a polynomial ideal. 

Given an ideal $I$ and $V_{\bbC}(I)$, it is clear that any $f \in I$ vanishes on $V_{\bbC}(I)$, that is 
$$
I \subseteq I(V_{\bbC}(I)).
$$
However, not all polynomials that vanish on $V_{\bbC}(I)$ belong to $I$.

::: {.theorembox}
::: {.theorem #HilbertNull name="Hilbert's Nullstellensatz"}
Let $I \subseteq \bbC[x]$ be an ideal.

- (Weak Nullstellensatz) If $V_{\bbC}(I) = \emptyset$, then $1 \in I$.

- (Strong Nullstellensatz) For $f \in \bbC[x]$, if $f(u) = 0$ for all $u \in V_{\bbC}(I)$, then $f^k \in I$ for some integer $k \geq 1$, i.e., $I(V_{\bbC}(I)) = \sqrt{I}$.
:::
:::

Let us see an example of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.

::: {.examplebox}
::: {.example #HilbertNullstellensatz name="Hilbert's Nullstellensatz"}
Consider the ideal 
$$
I=\Ideal[x_1^2 x_2^3, x_1 x_2^4].
$$
The affine variety defined by $I$ is
$$
V = V_{\bbC}(I) = \cbrace{(x_1,x_2) \in \bbC^2 \mid x_1^2 x_2^3 = 0, x_1 x_2^4=0}.
$$
It is easy to see that the variety is the union of the two coordinate axes $x_1=0$ and $x_2 = 0$.

Therefore, the polynomial $x_1x_2$ vanishes on the variety $V$, but $x_1 x_2$ does not belong to the ideal $I$ (because the degree is lower).

We claim that
$$
\sqrt{I} = \Ideal[x_1 x_2].
$$
Indeed, $x_1 x_2 \in \sqrt{I}$ because 
$$
(x_1x_2)^3 = x_1^3 x_2^3 = x_1 \cdot x_1^2 x_3^3 \in I.
$$
Conversely, if $f \in \sqrt{I}$, then $f^k \in I$ for some integer $k$, i.e.,
$$
f^k = x_1^2 x_2^3 p(x) + x_1 x_2^4 q(x) = x_1 x_2 r(x)
$$
which implies $f^k \in \Ideal[x_1 x_2]$. Therefore, all the polynomials that vanish on the variety $V$ can be generated by $x_1 x_2$.

As another example, consider the ideal generated by a single univariate polynomial
$$
I = \Ideal[f], \quad f = \prod_{i=1}^{s} (x - a_i)^{n_i}
$$
with $a_i \neq a_j$ for $i \neq j$ the unique roots of the polynomial $f$. Clearly, the affine variety defined by $I$ is the set of unique roots:
$$
V= V_{\bbC}(I) = \{a_1,\dots,a_s\}.
$$
The vanishing ideal of $V$ is 
$$
\sqrt{I} = \Ideal[(x-a_1)\cdots (x-a_s)].
$$

### Gröbner Bases 

A polynomial ideal can have different "descriptions" in terms of its generators. We will now focus on a particular type of description that is better than the others.

Let's first define a monomial ordering.

::: {.definitionbox}
::: {.definition #MonomialOrdering name="Monomial Ordering"}
A monomial ordering on $\bbC[x]$ is a binary relation $\succ$ on $\bbN^n$, i.e., the exponents of the monomials, that satisfies 

1. The relation $\succ$ is a total ordering, i.e., given any two monomials $x^{\alpha}, x^{\beta}$, we must have either $x^{\alpha} \succ x^{\beta}$, or $x^\beta \succ x^\alpha$, or $x^\alpha = x^\beta$.

2. If $x^\alpha \succ x^\beta$, then $x^\alpha \cdot x^\gamma \succ x^\beta \cdot x^\gamma$ for any monomial $x^\gamma$.

3. The relation $\succ$ is well ordered, i.e., every nonempty set has a smallest element under $\succ$.

:::
:::

There are several monomial orderings of interest in computational algebra.

- **Lexicographic** ("dictionary"). Here $\alpha \lexsucc \beta$ if the left-most nonzero entry of $\alpha - \beta$ is positive. Note that a particular ordering of the variables is assumed.

- **Graded lexicographic**. Sort first by total degree, then Lexicographic, i.e., $\alpha \grlexsucc \beta$ if $\abs{\alpha} > \abs{\beta}$, or $\abs{\alpha} = \abs{\beta}$ and $\alpha \lexsucc \beta$.

- **Graded reverse lexicographic**. Here $\alpha \grevlexsucc \beta$ if $\abs{\alpha} > \abs{\beta}$ or $\abs{\alpha} = \abs{\beta}$ but the right-most nonzero entry of $\alpha - \beta$ is negative. This ordering, although somewhat nonintuitive, has some desirable computational properties.

::: {.examplebox}
::: {.example #MonomialOrdering name="Monomial Ordering"}
Consider the polynomial ring $\bbC[x,y]$ in two variables. With the lexicographic ordering $\lexprec$, we have 
$$
1 \lexprec y \lexprec y^2 \lexprec \cdots \lexprec x \lexprec xy \lexprec xy^2 \lexprec \cdots \lexprec x^2 \lexprec x^2 y \lexprec x^2 y^2 \lexprec \cdots.
$$
For the other two orderings $\grlexprec$ and $\grevlexprec$, which in the case of two variables are the same, we have 
$$
1 \prec y \prec x \prec y^2 \prec xy \prec x^2 \prec y^3 \prec xy^2 \prec x^2 y \prec x^3 \prec \cdots.
$$

As another example, consider the monomials $\alpha = x^3 y^2 z^8$ and $\beta = x^2 y^9 z^2$. If the variables are ordered as $(x,y,z)$, then 
$$
\alpha \lexsucc \beta, \quad \alpha \grlexsucc \beta, \quad \alpha \grevlexprec \beta.
$$
Note that $x \succ y \succ z$ for all three orderings.
:::
:::

We define a monomial ideal.

::: {.definitionbox}
::: {.definition #MonomialIdeal name="Monomial Ideal"}
A monomial ideal is a polynomial ideal that can be generated by monomials.
:::
:::
What are the possible monomials that belong to a given monomial ideal? Since $x^\alpha \in I \Rightarrow x^{\alpha + \beta} \in I$ for any $\beta \geq 0$, we have that these sets are "closed upwards".

A polynomial belongs to a monomial ideal $I$ if and only if its terms are in $I$. 

Similarly, we have that every monomial ideal is finitely generated.

::: {.theorembox}
::: {.theorem #Dickson name="Dickson's Lemma"}
Every monomial ideal is finitely generated.
:::
:::

We next consider a special monomial ideal, associated with every polynomial ideal. From now on, we assume a fixed monomial ordering (e.g., graded reverse lexicographic), and define the notion of an initial ideal.

::: {.definitionbox}
::: {.definition #InitialIdeal name="Initial Ideal"}
Denote by $\initial{f}$ the "largest" (or leading) monomial appearing in the polynomial $f\neq 0$. Consider an ideal $I \subset \bbC[x]$ with a fixed monomial ordering. The initial ideal of $I$, denoted by $\initial{I}$, is the monomial ideal generated by the leading monomials of all the elements in $I$, i.e.,
$$
\initial{I} = \Ideal[\cbrace{\initial{f} \mid f \in I \backslash \{0\}}].
$$
A monomial $x^\alpha$ is called **standard** if it does not belong to the initial ideal $\initial{I}$.
:::
:::

Given an ideal $I = \Ideal[f_1,\dots,f_s]$, we can construct two monomial ideals associated with it:

- The initial ideal $\initial{I}$ as defined in Definition \@ref(def:InitialIdeal).

- The monomial ideal generated by the leading monomials of the generators, i.e., 
$$
\Ideal[\initial{f_1},\dots,\initial{f_s}].
$$

Clearly, we have
$$
\Ideal[\initial{f_1},\dots,\initial{f_s}] \subseteq \initial{I}.
$$

::: {.examplebox}
::: {.example #InitialIdeal name="Initial Ideal and the Ideal of Initials"}
Consider the ideal
$$
I = \Ideal[x^3 -1, x^2 + 1],
$$
we have $1 \in I$ due to 
$$
1 = \frac{1}{2}(x-1)(x^3 - 1) - \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - x - 1)(x^2 +1).
$$
Therefore, $\initial{I} = I = \bbC[x]$. On the other hand, the monomial ideal generated by the leading monomials is 
$$
\Ideal[x^3, x^2],
$$
and clearly does not contain $1$.
:::
:::

We have seen that in general these two monomial ideals are not the same. However, is it possible to find a set of generators for which the two monomial ideals are the same? This is exactly the notion of a Gröbner basis.

::: {.definitionbox}
::: {.definition #GrobnerBasis name="Gröbner Basis"}
Consider the polynomial ring $\bbC[x]$, a fixed monomial ordering, and an ideal $I$. A finite set of polynomials $\cbrace{g_1,\dots,g_s} \subset I$ is a Gröbner basis of $I$ if the initial ideal of $I$ is generated by the leading terms of the $g_i$'s, i.e., 
$$
\initial{I} = \Ideal[\initial{g_1},\dots,\initial{g_s}].
$$
:::
:::

We have the result that every ideal has a Grobner basis.

::: {.theorembox}
::: {.theorem #GrobnerBasis name="Gröbner Basis"}
Every ideal $I$ has a Grobner basis. Further, $I = \Ideal[g_1,\dots,g_s]$.
:::
:::

Theorem \@ref(thm:GrobnerBasis) indeed proves the Hilbert Basis Theorem \@ref(thm:HilbertBasisTheorem). 

Note that the Grobner basis as defined is not unique. It can be fixed to define a so-called **reduced Gröbner Basis**, which is unique when fixing a monomial ordering.

There exist numerical algorithms that can compute the Grobner basis. The most well-known algorithm is called Buchberger's algorithm, developed by Bruno Buchberger around 1965. The algorithm, however, is in general slow because it is double exponential time. Several software packages provide implementations that can compute the Grobner basis, for example Mathematica, Maple, Macaulay2, and Matlab.

::: {.examplebox}
::: {.example #GrobnerBasis name="Grobner Basis"}
Consider the ideal $I = \Ideal[x^2+y^2-2, x^2 - y^2]$. The affine variety of $I$ is finite and only contains four points $(\pm 1, \pm 1)$. It is easy to see that the given generators are not a Grobner basis. 

Computing a Grobner basis (e.g., using the [Matlab `gbasis` function](https://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/sym.gbasis.html)) gives us
$$
\cbrace{x^2 - 1, y^2 - 1}.
$$
The standard monomials are $\cbrace{1,x,y,xy}$.
:::
:::

We will see that Grobner basis is a powerful tool with many applications in computational algebra.
